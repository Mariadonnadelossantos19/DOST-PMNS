A Permittree is a tree-based permission structure where:

Each node in the tree represents an entity, such as a user, process, thread, or resource.

Edges represent hierarchical relationships (e.g., parent-child permissions).

Permissions (or permits) can be granted, revoked, or inherited through this hierarchy.

Itâ€™s often used in systems that implement fine-grained access control, mutual exclusion (mutex), or distributed synchronization mechanisms.
